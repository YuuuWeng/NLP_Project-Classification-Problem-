(4) the reemergence of infectious diseases in the fall typically is accompanied by mutations to the infectious agent enabling it to infectall individuals, young and old and typically more virulent as well.(5) which brings me to point 4. .) the actions mandated by public health officials, schools, and businesses worldwide are by no accounts an overreaction.the prevention of the spread of disease not only helps our health professionals, hospitals, and public health organizations treat individuals, but also decreases risk of mutations in covid-19 which would be responsible for a reemergence of covid-19 in the fall able to severelyaffect all individuals as the more covid-19 is able to replicate in a host the more likely a beneficial mutation (from perspective of the virus) is to arise. (6) the stopping of the spread of covid-19 now is crucial to preventing the spread later, and for protecting the elderly,immunocompromised, and those with pre-existing conditions. it should also be noted that not extending the course of the covid-19 virus in the population disproportionately affects those of lower socioeconomic statuses and those who are more likely to return to their workplace asa result of financial need leading to increased spread. (7,8) i would never make a claim to be an expert on this topic, and i applaud and look up to those who have spent their lives conducting research on infectious diseases.i am, however, passionate about this particular area of science and passionate about education and educating the general public about infectious diseases. i highly encourage everyone of you to do your research, educate yourself on how you can best help yourself, your family,and your community. the efforts to stop the spread of this disease begin on the individual level and are part of a global effort. the actions of individuals today will have resounding impacts in months and years to come.i urge you to be safe and think of others in addition to yourself. references ) ) ) ) )) ) )",0

0,"cold weather and snow cannot kill the new coronavirus. there is no reason to believe that cold weather can kill the new coronavirus or other diseases. the normal human body temperature remains around c to c, regardless of the external temperature or weather.by doing this you eliminate viruses that may be on your hands and avoid infection that could occur by then touching your eyes, mouth, and nose. new coronavirus is a respiratory virus which spreads primarily through droplets generated when an infected person coughs or sneezes, or through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose.to protect yourself, clean your hands frequently with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. also, avoid close contact with anyone who is coughing and sneezing. hand dryers effective in killing the new coronavirus? no. hand dryers are not effective in killing the -ncov. to protect yourself against the new coronavirus, you should frequently clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water.once your hands are cleaned, you should dry them thoroughly by using paper towels or a warm air dryer. an ultraviolet disinfection lamp kill the new coronavirus? uv lamps should not be used to sterilize hands or other areas of skin as uv radiation can cause skin irritation. effective are thermal scanners in detecting people infected with the new coronavirus? thermal scanners are effective in detecting people who have developed a fever (i.e. have a higher than normal body temperature) because of infection with the new coronavirus.however, they cannot detect people who are infected but are not yet sick with fever. this is because it takes between and days before people who are infected become sick and develop a fever. spraying alcohol or chlorine all over your body kill the new coronavirus? no. spraying alcohol or chlorine all over your body will not kill viruses that have already entered your body.spraying such substances can be harmful to clothes or mucous membranes (i.e. eyes, mouth). be aware that both alcohol and chlorine can be useful to disinfect surfaces, but they need to be used under appropriate recommendations. vaccines against pneumonia protect you against the new coronavirus? no. vaccines against pneumonia, such as pneumococcal vaccine and haemophilus influenza type b (hib) vaccine, do not provide protection against the new coronavirus.the virus is so new and different that it needs its own vaccine. researchers are trying to develop a vaccine against -ncov, and who is supporting their efforts.although these vaccines are not effective against -ncov, vaccination against respiratory illnesses is highly recommended to protect your health. regularly rinsing your nose with saline help prevent infection with the new coronavirus? no. there is no evidence that regularly rinsing the nose with saline has protected people from infection with the new coronavirus.there is some limited evidence that regularly rinsing nose with saline can help people recover more quickly from the common cold. however, regularly rinsing the nose has not been shown to prevent respiratory infections. eating garlic help prevent infection with the new coronavirus? garlic is a healthy food that may have some antimicrobial properties. however, there is no evidence from the current outbreak that eating garlic has protected people from the new coronavirus. the new coronavirus affect older people, or are younger people also susceptible? people of all ages can be infected by the new coronavirus (2019-ncov).older people, and people with pre-existing medical conditions (such as asthma, diabetes, heart disease) appear to be more vulnerable to becoming severely ill with the virus.who advises people of all ages to take steps to protect themselves from the virus, for example by following good hand hygiene and good respiratory hygiene. antibiotics effective in preventing and treating the new coronavirus? no, antibiotics do not work against viruses, only bacteria. the new coronavirus (2019-ncov) is a virus and, therefore, antibiotics should not be used as a means of prevention or treatment.however, if you are hospitalized for the -ncov, you may receive antibiotics because bacterial co-infection is possible. there any specific medicines to prevent or treat the new coronavirus? to date, there is no specific medicine recommended to prevent or treat the new coronavirus (2019-ncov).however, those infected with the virus should receive appropriate care to relieve and treat symptoms, and those with severe illness should receive optimized supportive care.some specific treatments are under investigation, and will be tested through clinical trials. who is helping to accelerate research and development efforts with a range or partners. pls don't panic people with fake news because it's not real all facts are in these threads",0

""systemic racism"" is a thing of the past. let me be clear. i am not saying there was not a time that it doesn't.. exist, but we led the way in abolishing it. am i saying there is not a racist out there here and there that work in these industries you tour as flawed at their core? no, i'm not saying that because that would be ridiculous. if you are trying to get rid of all the racists in the world, i fear you are going to be sorely disappointed in your ability to mold an individual to what you want them to be. racists come in all shapes sizes and colors, and should be called out for what they are. but as individuals, not by burning down the systems and institutions that made this country great in the first place. racism in our institutions is illegal, and if you can point me to a specific instance where a minority person was targeted or excluded solely because of the color of their skin, i will be the first person to stand right next to you and demand justice for that person. but the whole thought that the ""systems"" are built and maintained to keep minorities down, right here, right now, is just completely false and all too often used to diminish the responsibility of an individual to chose what they do with their life. people are put in shitty situations, regardless of skin color. has more to do with poverty and parents than anything. some people decide to break the cycle and make something of themselves, others do not. has nothing to do with the amount of melanin in their skin, and all about their willingness to succeed. anyway, i am sure this all falls on deaf ears regardless, but trying to explain my position because you asked. point to the specofic system where the issue resides and what the issue is... then we can talk about it. i may even be on your side. but to say the results must be an overall systemic problem is pretty vague. not sure how you expect any change when that is what you tout? the mortgage deal has been debunked countless times. prison population couldn't be a result of crimes committed? i hear you when you say they are sentenced more harshly, whats the answer? don't commit crime in the first place would be a novel place to start for any race.",0

0,"what are the symptoms of covid-19? the most common symptoms of covid-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough. some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. these symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. does covid-19 spread? people can catch covid-19 from others who have the virus. the disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with covid-19 coughs or exhales.some people become infected but dont develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell. most people (about %) recover from the disease without needing special treatment. around out of every people who gets covid-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing.older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness. people with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical attention.these droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person. other people then catch covid-19 by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth. people can also catch covid-19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with ++covid-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets. this is why it is important to stay more than meter (3 feet) away from a person who is sick.can the virus that causes covid-19 be transmitted through the air? studies to date suggest that the virus that causes covid-19 is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air. can covid-19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms?the main way the disease spreads is through respiratory droplets expelled by someone who is coughing. the risk of catching covid-19 from someone with no symptoms at all is very low. however, many people with covid-19 experience only mild symptoms.this is particularly true at the early stages of the disease. it is therefore possible to catch covid-19 from someone who has, for example, just a mild cough and does not feel ill.you can reduce your chances of being infected or spreading covid-19 by taking some simple precautions: regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water.why? washing your hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand rub kills viruses that may be on your hands. maintain at least metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing. why?when someone coughs or sneezes they spray small liquid droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus. if you are too close, you can breathe in the droplets, including the covid-19 virus if the person coughing has the disease. avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth. why?hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses. once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth. from there, the virus can enter your body and can make you sick. make sure you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene.this means covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. then dispose of the used tissue immediately. why?droplets spread virus. by following good respiratory hygiene you protect the people around you from viruses such as cold, flu and covid-19. stay home if you feel unwell. if you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in advance.follow the directions of your local health authority. why? national and local authorities will have the most up to date information on the situation in your area. calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility.this will also protect you and help prevent spread of viruses and other infections. keep up to date on the latest covid-19 hotspots (cities or local areas where covid-19 is spreading widely). if possible, avoid traveling to places especially if you are an older person or have++diabetes, heart or lung disease. why? you have a higher chance of catching covid-19 in one of these areas. for more information, please contact us. e-mail: info.com bgghealthcare health healthy healthylifestyle healthcare coronavirus coronaturkey covid19",0

0,"as of today,169,906covid-19 cases have been confirmed, resulting in6,644fatalities worldwide. after its discovery last december, in wuhan, china, the virus started to spread around the world, causing panic.how do the seven human coronaviruses differ? the main difference lies in the severity of the illnesses they cause. the first four respiratory viruses range from mild to medium, while sars and mers can cause respiratory illness of high severity.how do viruses work? a virus is a protein box with genetic material inside which needs a living cell to replicate. it enters the cell through binding with receptors and reprogrammes it to make copies of itself, working as a template to replicate more viruses inside the body.how does covid-19 spread? at the moment, we know that the virus is transmitted through contaminated droplets. droplets of saliva or mucus carrying the respiratory virus can travel one to three metres through coughing or sneezing.the virus needs to fully enter the respiratory tract for infection to happen, but that's why the risk of infection can be reduced by avoiding close contact with sick people. washing your hands thoroughly greatly reduces the risk of infection.there are reports that infection is possible through faeces and recirculated air ventilation systems and air conditioners. but this has not been systematically studied, so it is hard to say with per cent certainty.how deadly is the new coronavirus compared to sars, mers and the four coronaviruses that cause the common cold? we cannot determine this for certain as the apparent mortality rate is likely to be overestimated at the start of an outbreak, because a lot of mild cases are missed.also, with covid-19, some people can be asymptomatic - meaning the virus is not always detected and therefore not recorded. the mortality rate for influenza is per cent, but since covid-19 is so new it remains to be seen just how many cases will turn out to be fatal.it is commonly cited that in a given year with no complications, influenza kills people. compared to the four respiratory coronaviruses, the mortality rate for sars-cov-2 is higher.although compared to sars (9.6 per cent) and mers (34.4 per cent), covid-19 shows a low mortality rate but with a wider spread, making the total number of deaths larger.can summer, or warmer temperatures help eradicate the virus? for some respiratory viruses this does happen. not because of the temperature, but also thanks to the humidity and changes in social patterns of human beings. in this case, it is still premature to say.",0

0,"in what way? this one spreads far quicker, and it has already reached far more people than sars did. also, it takes to weeks to die, and so nobody knows the fatality death rate yet. right off, his data is wrong. it started early december - not the th december. also the world health orgaization says it's worse than sars. from who info page. is covid-19 the same as sars? no. the virus that causes covid-19 and the one that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars) are related to each other genetically, but they are different. sars is more deadly but much less infectious than covid-19. yes, i know that. but it takes approximately weeks from the date of manifestation of the illness (not the incubation period) to die. most people have not recovered yet. so the death rate might be a lot higher. the fact that sars didn't spread easily means it was less dangerous. if a disease only spreads to a thousand people, and it kills %, that is only a dead. if a disease spreads to million people, and it kills % (current fatality rate), it kills people. it is the ease of spreading that makes it more dangerous. i would still put that on par with a bad flu bug, most people don't die from it and that fatality percentage can change based on how it's reacted to and where geographically you look. with proper prevention this won't result in a pandemic.",0

(note r0 varies w/ behavior, host traits, environment so differs over time&ampace).in idealized population, early vaccination to hit will prevent outbreak b/c rt=r0*s/n so rt&lt;1. however, an epidemic will overshoot hit &amp; infect larger fraction f of pop where f=1-exp(-(f*r0)). for r0=2.5 (reasonable for covid19 in some pops), hit=0.6, and f = .these simple calculations &amp; flu data are what led to make early widely cited rough back of the envelope calculations that -70% of pop would get infected without interventions. most articles cited the % *but* knew that... ) if some individuals have few contacts then they are unlikely to be infected, lowering hit. (note: variation in contacts can lead to faster early spread). ) if some aren't susceptible to infection that reduces hit. )if some people don't transmit that also reduces hit.positive correlations among these traits - if individuals w/ more contacts are more susceptible and infectious - can make for very rapid changes in dynamics. sadly not much empirical data on these correlations &amp; limited data on predictors of variation on susc. &amp; infect.however, see paper by that is even better (b/c more general, better data) than science paper cited above. fig shows how variation susc, contacts affects hit, f, for r0=3; so hit=0.66, f = . paper (link above) also shows how reasonable variation in contact rates among individuals reduces hit. it considers differential mixing among age groups and hypothetical variation among individuals w/in each age group having more or fewer contacts.the strange part is that it's not clear what source their age-mixing data comes from. the citation they give is not a published paper - it's a link to a page w/ matlab files. it's weird because there are several age-mixing datasets out there. can probably provide best onesthe take home of the science paper is that pops partially structured by age (i.e. not well-mixed) and w/ arbitrary differential ""activity"" (contact rates) w/in ages can reduce hit for r0=2.5 from to . conclusion in the abstract is appropriately worded in making it clear that the paper is simply an illustration of a concept, not an actual estimate of the most likely value. i find puzzling is that this paper is in science. it's a extremely simple modeling exercise, with arbitrarily chosen parameter values. it isn't as general as paper cited above, and it's not clear it has any new empirical data. many older papers say same thing. paper is much better in providing empirical estimates of heterogeneity &amp; impacts on hit, f based on data (colored lines in figure). like to see uncertainty around those estimates of heterogeneity &amp; some are very indirect estimates, but range of values is much better than arbitrarily chosen numbers and suggest heterogeneity is substantial. but ...serological data from nyc suggest that either heterogeneity estimate is too large or r0 is much larger, or lockdown did nothing to stop outbreak as seroprevalence is already at overhsoot epidemic size f (~20% - i added horiz dashed line). papers suggest herd immunity thresh is &lt;1-1/r0 and epidemic overshoot &lt;f=1-exp(-(f*r0)), but by how much is still unknown. ugh. smartly gave a wide range -70% (20-60% in later interviews) for fraction infected f w/out interventions. , uncertainties in variation in contact rates and susceptibility/infectiousness will prevent us from ever having precise value for hit for pop &amp; it will vary among populations (as does r0). the take home message is want to get to hit by vaccination not infection. did some work on this in or so also when i recall correctly: ""a programme targeting just five per cent of the population could reduce the number of infected people to just one per cent of the scenario where no antiviral drugs were available."" this is likely true for diseases with very strong heterogeneity (i.e. a few important spreaders; heterogeneity is thought to be less so for respiratory illnesses but still substantial). are you aware of any natural or experimental data showing significant divergence (say &gt; %) from the canonical immunity threshold (aside from hiv or stis with highly stratified risk groups)? covid19 without reading: the hu mangus differences in some people contracting and spreading. unroll please salam, please find the unroll here: : what is herdimmunity threshold for covid19? a topic of much discussion due to large uncertainty &amp; talk to you soon. do we know yet how much immunity someone who has recovered from the virus has, how long it lasts? not yet, sadly! yes. see link at end to interview with that mentions examples that indicate that heterogeneity can be substantial.

""we're fortunate we have a vaccine for the flu."" ""if we're familiar with it, it's less scary to us.""she notes because covid-19 is so new, there's little knowledge about what it will do and at this time no vaccine.ulmer says she doesn't know how many cases are in texas, but mensah says there are . ulmer said she knows percent of people who get coronavirus will just get (essentially) the common cold.i'm trying to get more info on this stat she's quoting. i know (thanks to thedaily i think) that the study that showed percent of people get mild symptoms included pneumonia. so, mild is relative here.ulmer said she's hearing anywhere between one and two years for the timeline to develop a vaccine.she says that's why it's important to continue ""tried and true"" healthcare methods. wash your hands, stay home when you're sick.clean services with antibacterial and antiviral sprays. lysol, clorox and are cdc-approved to kill the virus. ""we understand that the virus can last on surfaces for up to three hours.""feldschau asks how coronavirus is spread. he gives some facts he's heard and asks the panel to separate fact and fiction. he's been told it spreads through coughing and sneezing, lives several hours airborne and three days on hard surfaces and a person is contagious for days.ulmer reiterates that the virus lasts for three hours on hard surfaces. the virus is transmitted person-to-person. she says that can include being in close quarters with someone, simply talking to them because you can breath in the droplets.that's why six feet is the recommendation when doing social distancing.ulmer said the health department is putting together ""soemthing"" so people know what the next step is if jefferson county has a confirmed case.(i'm going to use tim's first name because his last name is hard to keep spelling.) so ... tim says the city wants to reduce the spread by taking preemptive measures. that includes limiting crowds, increasing the outreach and the encouragement of people to take precautionary /2measures. i would like to add, as of friday, the city had not cancelled any events that would limit crowds. the comment was at this time, danger is not high enough that that consideration needed to be taken. /2tim says ""we're not trying to scare people. there's a lot of bad information out there."" he encourages people to get information only from reputable sources, instead of looking at things on facebook or from friends and spreading it like it's a fact.""we would encourage people to be patient because it's a fluid situation."" - feldshau he notes that people questioned having a live audience when the panel was announced earlier this week. however when advice was given to keep events small, the church went to live streaming.ulmer says the city nine years ago developed a pandemic plan. and several times a year, the city gets together to talk about the plans and practice them.""we are as prepared as we can be with the information we're getting. of course it's fluid, but we're accustomed to these types of situations.""reiterating a point made previous, people most at risk are those and older and those with preexisting conditions. she said children diagnosed with coronavirus years and under are ""doing very well."" ""for our children it sounds like god has smiled on us.""now talking about ""flattening the curve."" people are trying to take protective measures to flatten the peak of infections. ""this is not here today and gone tomorrow."" -feldschauulmer said allowing the infections to peak so high would ""tax our healthcare system."" should the city/county get there, it would have to look at ""alternative"" ways to treat people. she didn't expand on what those alternatives are.she said that's one reason why people should call their doctor or emergency rooms before just showing up.""i we know that you're coming, the staff can be ready for you. they can meet you outside, they can give you a mask ... that's one way now we're trying to alleviate the workload on the healthcare system is to try to plan /2as best we can that people are going to be expected to coming in with complaints of difficulty breathing and thoughts of coronavirus."" /2feldshau says the state of emergency is not for where we are now, but as a precaution to avoid losing control in the future.

0,"what is covid19? coronaviruses are important human and animal pathogens. they have been known to cause a variety of disorders in humans, from the common cold to the more severe middle east respiratory syndrome (mers-cov) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars-cov).in december , a novel coronavirus was identified in emerging clusters of pneumonia (lung infection) cases in wuhan, china. the virus was previously termed ncov-2019. at the beginning of , the virus was officially named sars-cov-2, due to its similarities to the previoushow does covid-19 spread? initially, experts believe the virus started out in animals in wuhan, china; and was then transmitted to humans. the current version of the sars-cov-2 spreads from person-to-person, similar to the flu. this usually happens when a sick person coughs orsars-cov. the disease, as a whole, was then officially termed by the who as coronavirus disease , or covid-19.sneezes near other people, or when a person is in close contact with a sick person (within about feet or meters).what are the symptoms of covid-19? symptoms usually start a few days after a person is infected with the virus. but in some people, it can take even longer for symptoms to appear, thus the symptoms can appear anywhere between to days after exposure. symptoms can include: fever cough trouble breathing feeling tired muscle aches most people have mild symptoms. some people have no symptoms at all. but in other people, covid-19 can lead to serious problems like pneumonia, not getting enough oxygen, or even death.this is more common in people who are older or have other health problems.when should i see a doctor? if you have a fever, cough, or trouble breathing and might have been exposed to covid-19, call (the saudi moh service center) immediately. you might have been exposed if either of the following happened within the last days: you lived in, or traveled to, an area where lots of people have the virus the united states centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) has information about which areas are affected. this can be found on their website: ncov/travelers/index.html you had close contact with a person who has the virus this generally means being within about feet of the person. if your symptoms are not severe, it is best to call your doctor, nurse, or clinic before you go in. they can tell you what to do and where to go.if you do need to go to the clinic or hospital, you will need to put on a face mask. the staff might also have you wait someplace away from other people. if you are severely ill and need to go to the clinic or hospital right away, you should still call ahead.this way the staff can care for you while taking steps to protect others.how is covid-19 treated? most people with covid-19 have only mild illness and can rest at home until they get better. if you have a more severe illness, you might need to stay in the hospital, possibly in the intensive care unit (also called the ""icu"").there is no specific treatment for the infection, but the doctors and nurses in the hospital can monitor and support your breathing and other body functions; and make you as comfortable as possible, this is done through multiple ways, including external oxygen(e.g. oxygen mask), a ventilator (a machine that helps you breathe), and/or medication.can covid-19 be prevented? there are things you can do to reduce your chances of getting covid-19: wash your hands with soap and water often. wash your hands often with soap and water for at least seconds, especially after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing; going tothe bathroom; and before eating or preparing food. o if soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least % alcohol, covering all surfaces of your hands and rubbing them together until they feel dry. avoid touching your face (including your eyes, mouth, and nose) with your hands cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash, and wash your hands immediately after (as specified above). clean and disinfect frequently touched objects andsurfaces using a regular household cleaning spray or wipe. cdc does not recommend that people who are well and healthy wear a facemask to protect themselves from respiratory diseases, including covid-19. o facemasks should be used by people who show symptoms of covid-19 tohelp prevent the spread of the disease to others. the use of facemasks is also crucial for health workers and people who are taking care of someone who has covid-19. stay home when you are sick, and call your doctor if you think you have been exposed to covid- . try to stay away from people who have any symptoms of the infection. some experts recommend avoiding travel to certain countries where there are a lot of cases of covid-19. if someone in your home has covid-19, there are additional things you can do to protect yourself: keep the sick person away from others the sick person should stay in a separate room and use a separate bathroom if possible. use face masks the sick person should wear a face mask when they are in the same room as other people. if you are caring for the sick person,you can also protect yourself by wearing a face mask when you are in the room. this is especially important if the sick person cannot wear a mask. be extra careful around body fluids if you will be in contact with the sick person's blood, mucus, or other body fluids, wear adisposable face mask, gown, and gloves. if any bodily fluids touch your skin, wash your hands with soap right away. clean often it's especially important to clean things that are touched a lot. this includes counters, bedside tables, doorknobs, computers, phones, tablets,and bathroom surfaces. also, clean any surfaces that may have blood, stool, or body fluids on them. wash hands wash your hands with soap and water often (as specified above) you should not share dishes, drinking glasses, cups, eating utensils, towels, or bedding withother people or pets in your home. there is not yet a vaccine to prevent covid-19. how can i prepare for a possible outbreak? it is hard to predict where future outbreaks might happen. the best thing you can do to stay healthy is to wash your hands regularly, avoid close contactwith people who are sick, and stay home if you are sick. if there is an outbreak in your area, schools or businesses might close temporarily. if this happens, or if someone in your family gets sick with covid-19, you might need to stay at home for a period of time.there are things you can do to prepare for this. for example, you might be able to ask your employer if you can work from home, or take time off, if it becomes necessary. you can also make sure you have a way to get in touch with relatives, neighbors, and others in your area.this way you will be able to receive and share information easily. if you or others in your family are anxious about covid-19, keep in mind that most people do not get severely ill or die from it. while it helps to be prepared, and there are things you can do to lower your risk.where can i learn more? as we learn more about this virus, expert recommendations will continue to change. check with your doctor or public health official to get the most updated information about how to protect yourself. you can also find more information about covid-19 at thefollowing: united states centers for disease control and prevention (cdc): world health organization (who): the saudi ministry of health (moh): saudi moh coronavirus service center number: saudi national ambulance hotline:",1

i found it unsettling that while talking to dr. lapook you took another alcohol drink in the middle of his explanation of potential life saving drugs! this was disrespectful and inappropriate. do you have some drinking problem where you must drink while broadcasting your show? keep your clothes on stevo fever, dry cough, a whole pint container as long as its the whipped kind. nutella instead. can we give hydroxychloroquine? ask him why i am starting to resemble my sourdough starter. can my dog track the virus in after a walk? great show tonight. great guest! thank you some body said we have to wash our hands for minutes? is it right? no one has talked about building the immune system with what you eat and taking supplements. this can help mitigate the symptoms is to build a strong immune system. all i hear is drugs and vaccine. guess there is no money in foods and supplements. assume you saw the chyron guy who labeled everything being said in 's briefings with an overlay of truth? youtube not showing notifications for ur videos im just going to assume the answer to the frosting one is three or four tubs. whos a bigger pedophile... stephen colbert or steven spielberg? thank you if you eat the frosting while standing, it is exercise. trembling with fear burns calories. tuesday night was hilarious! your team is doing great job producing an entertaining show on the fly. sort of like replacing an airplane engine in flight. why no mention of this life saving treatment approved by fda for emergency use??

example: ""when can we hug again?"". answer: ""hugging is good for you."" if viewers want evasion, we get that with trump's press conferences. how about a good honest, ""i don't know.""? unless this was satire it was wastedtime i miss the studio audience, too. have you considered trying a zoom virtual audience? i could never see your show live, so i would love the opportunity to be a part of your zoom audience! highlight of my week: i shave on wednesdays. what's your highlight? bothered me he said the drug trump was pushing like a dealer with no scientific proof and condemned by the ama this dr said was part of the standard protocol in treating patients maybe this is a new york thing i as a patient would like the right to refuse it very good questions about covid19. thank you for bringing drlapook to your program. i am getting tired of cooking but i have been afraid of ordering. now i feel a little more confident about deliveries. in a graham cracker i would like to say as much as it takes...and dont forget the tall glass of milk! why do progressive agents wear aprons?

wtf? you've become a sad clown! what did joe biden ever do to you? you should interview john krasinski! he has this amazing show called some good news and i think he would be a great person to interview. in other news, trump is withholding funds for physicists, saying its their fault that fire is hot and has burned people. trumpvirus thanks for doing your show. i hope you can feel our laughter across the airwaves. my phone is running out of geodatum and some guys tried to trip me in the woods near looking for walsh so i might not be able to tweet your site. hug. can i have another?

(note: i have not said whether i am for or against a ubi.) accept is a mental state we need it because the current system of distribution (fed loans to commercial loans to payrolls) is pretty much at a standstill and restarting will take a decade. each heartbeat gets a ubi reminds me of the fiona apple line: he said, its all in your head. i said, sos everything but he didnt get it.

1,"thread about some popular myths on corona virus . spraying chlorine or alcohol on skin kills viruses in the body applying alcohol or chlorine to the body can cause more harm. disinfect surfaces not skin these cannot kill viruses within the body!!2. older people (&gt;60) and young (&lt;14) are at risk sars-cov-2, like other coronaviruses, can infect people of any age. however, anyone with preexisting health conditions, like cancer, diabetes, lung infections, immunodeficiency is likely to get affected.9. sars-cov-2 is just a mutated form of the common cold all coronaviruses belong to family of coronoviridae and have surface spike proteins that help them invade host, which can be humans/animals. covid19 is thought to be passed from animals/poultry to humans.6. cats and dogs spread coronavirus currently, very little evidence. however, in hong kong, a pomeranian whose owner had covid-19 became infected. the dog did not display any symptoms and this leads to an imp ques to differentiate infection from virus . face masks protect against coronavirus disposable face masks may not provide protection. yes it is better than nothing but most masks dont fit properly, droplets can still enter the mouth and nose. thus viral particles can also enter. . hand dryers kill coronavirus hand dryers dont kill. only soap and water is the best way followed by alcohol based sanitizers to protect oneself9-2. thus some infect humans and many infect animals too. the best way to avoid such infections is stop eating meat and follow a more satvik diet. this suggestion may draw flak from others but thats the truth. sars and mers were also passed m animals to humans.10. antibiotics kill coronavirus antibiotics only kill bacteria and not viruses.14. thermal scanners can diagnose coronavirus thermal scanners can detect only fever that can be caused by many reasons covid-19 symptoms only days after infection, and an infection person maybe completely normal to begin with.15. flu and pneumonia vaccines protect against covid-19 as sars-cov-2 is different than other viruses, no existing vaccines protect against infection. so please dont panic, follow the govt rules of curfew/isolation &amp;eat healthy. finally dont forget to pray. shambho mahadeva",23

""a chi devo fare riferimento?"", ""di chi mi devo fidare"", sono domande che si vedono molto spesso. la comunit scientifica racchiude le conoscenze che abbiamo verificato e nella maggioranza dei casi ci che va' preso per riferimento, non bisogna riporre troppa fiducia nelle varie personalit. a prescindere dalla loro autorevolezza. ma nn sono quelli i temi su cui si chiede fiducia. burioni nn fa un claim scientifico da mesi. ""state a casa"" nn un claim scientifico. e' una opzione di policy con dei pro e dei contro che tra le tante cose ha un effetto sui tassi di contagio se eseguita. non scienza / scienza dire ""se state a casa probabilmente il tasso di contagio si riduce"". il ""quindi state a casa a qualunque costo"" non scienza. no. l'oms ha detto che stare a casa il miglior modo per ridurre i contagi. non probabilmente. lo hanno affermato con certezza. ed confermato dai numeri. non lo dice burioni, n nessun altro. lo dice l'organizzazione mondiale della sanit. cmq no, scientificamente provabile che il modo per garantire azzeramento dei contagi + che in ogni alternativa uccidere tutti gli esseri umani. se li uccidi tutti non hai + contagi tra umani. partendo da l, possiamo capire come il dire cosa ""minimizza"" nn serve mai a nulla. quindi secondo te l'oms dovrebbe consigliare di fare una strage? a che pro, se il virus gira da settembre nel mondo e chiss quanta gente contagiata? se vai sul loro sito sta scritto chiaramente che il modo migliore per prevenire il contagio l'isolamento sociale, se tu poi ritieni che sia un altro il modo migliore stai dando la tua opinione. definisci ""migliore"". nn trovo su loro sito lista di tutte le possibili misure di contenimento con la stima della riduzione di r0 per ciascuna, e invece quello dovrebbero fare. poi politica sceglie con loro zitti mentre si sceglie. guarda la sezione ""what can i do to protect myself and prevent thespread of disease?"" nelle faq per il pubblico e vedi tutti i suggerimenti che danno alle persone per ridurre al minimo il contagio la politica anche responsabile della ""intromissione"" degli scienziati, eh. se tu prendi una decisione e scarichi la colpa sul parere del tecnico, te ne stai lavando le mani. ancora, nn cogli cosa intendo. loro devono dire ""chiusura fabbrica impatta x su tassi di contagio"". poi paese fa i suoi conti e decide se preferisce tenerle aperte o no, dato che ogni chiusura ha dei costi, economici e sociali, dall'analisi dei quali i medici devono stare fuori.",0

0,"i've read a lot about corona virus lately and i think i should share some highlights of the good read. it's a thread, and in form of q &amp; a.what is a coronavirus? coronavirus is a large family of viruses which may cause illness in animals or humans.in humans, several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging from common cold to mers &amp; sars. the most recently discovered coronavirus is covid-19.what is covid-19? covid-19 is the infectious disease caused by the most recently discovered coronavirus. this new virus and disease were unknown before the outbreak began in wuhan, china, in december .the most common symptoms of covid-19 are fever, tiredness, &amp; dry cough. some patients may have aches &amp; pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. these symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. some people become infected but dont develop any symptoms.older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness. people with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical attention.how does covid-19 spread? people can catch covid-19 from others who have the virus. the disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with covid-19 coughs or exhales.how likely am i to catch covid-19? the risk depends on where you are - and more specifically, whether there is a covid-19 outbreak unfolding there.should i worry about covid-19? although illness due to covid-19 infection is generally mild, especially for children and young adults. it is still quite normal for people to worry about how the covid-19 outbreak will affect them and their loved ones.are antibiotics effective in preventing or treating the covid-19? no. antibiotics do not work against viruses, they only work on bacterial infections. covid-19 is caused by a virus, so antibiotics do not work.is there a vaccine, drug or treatment for covid-19? not yet. to date, there is no vaccine and no specific antiviral medicine to prevent or treat covid-2019. however, those affected should receive care to relieve symptoms. people with serious illness should be hospitalized.is covid-19 the same as sars? no. the virus that causes covid-19 and the one that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars) are related to each other genetically, but they are different. sars is more deadly but much less infectious than covid-19.should i wear a mask to protect myself? only wear a mask if you are ill with covid-19 symptoms (especially coughing) or looking after someone who may have covid-19. the mask can only be used once. if you are not ill/looking after someone who is ill then you are wasting a mask.can i catch covid-19 from my pet? no. there is no evidence that companion animals or pets such as cats and dogs have been infected or could spread the virus that causes covid-19.is there anything i should not do? the following measures are not effective against covid-2019 and can be harmful: . smoking . taking traditional herbal remedies . wearing multiple masks . taking self-medication such as antibiotics.in any case, if you have fever, cough and difficulty breathing seek medical care early to reduce the risk of developing a more severe infection and be sure to share your recent travel history with your health care provider. coronaalert coronavirus coronaoutbreak thread",2

the main way the disease spreads is through respiratory droplets expelled by someone who is coughing. the risk of catching covid-19 from someone with no symptoms at all is very low. however, frediboatpart can i catch covid-19 from the feces of someone with the disease? the risk of catching covid-19 from the feces of an infected person appears to be low. while initial investigations suggest the virus may be present in feces in some cases, spread through this frediboatpart route is not a main feature of the outbreak. who is assessing ongoing research on the ways covid-19 is spread and will continue to share new findings. frediboatpart because this is a risk, however, it is another reason to clean hands regularly, after using the bathroom and before eating frediboatpart what can i do to protect myself and prevent thespread of disease?

0,"so people assume how many remain susceptible can be estimated by subtracting those with positive antibodies (serology) from the total. is this consistent with what is being observed? covid19 /xa ubiquitous assumption made is, that at the start, all in the population are susceptible if exposed to a new virus such as sar-cov-2. but is this assumption always correct? covid19 /xas a pandemic evolves, the susceptible are consider to be those that remain after one excludes those infected and recovered. it is difficult to precisely determine at a given time who is infected because of the dynamic nature of the disease. covid19 /xmost serologic assays have ranged from -3% all the way up to -30% in areas such as new york city. and the curve seems to be ending in nyc. what gives? covid19 /xsimilarly, in a recent study of an isolated alpine community in austria shows that even in a close-knit community only a fraction of people became infected. covid19 /x seems the pandemic has stopped in that community, with a high antibody prevalence of %. notably, children were less likely to be infected. covid19 /xin another study, it was also shown that children are less likely to be infected, with a hypothesis being that this is driven by lower expression of the ace2 receptor. covid19 /x fascinating study of a ship expedition to the antarctic showed that even in close proximity a significant faction of people did not become infected. h/t covid19 /x it seems likely we cannot estimate the fraction of susceptible individuals by merely determining this by the lack of specific sar-cov-2 protective antibodies. covid19 /xhow could this be? is it possible not all are likely to be infected? i suspect this is multifactorial and mostly hypothetical. i will share two possibilities others have explored. covid19 /xthe most likely explanation is that there are some mechanisms that have evolved over the course of human/primates/mammal evolution and that there is some possibility of cross-immunity derived from other coronaviruses. covid19 /xthis is hard to prove but it is possible that evolution has selected traits making humans more resilient to coronaviruses exposure. perhaps our ancestors or even lemurs already had major existential threats in the past! thank you! covid19 /x could we be protected? it is impossible to tell. our knowledge about coronaviruses is limited as is true for most science. maybe polymorphisms in receptors, immunity, or other ways. we might never know. but we do know evolutionary pathways select covid19 /xanother possibility is cross-reactivity to other coronaviruses. one such study has shown that as a possibility. they found t cell reactivity from viable t cells stored before sars-cov-2. in nearly one-half of cases! covid19 /x study was small but very provocative. if confirmed, this means that these individuals with such reactivity would need to be subtracted from the ""s"" (as in susceptible). in other words, you can be functionally ""immune"" even if not exposed covid19 /x , and somewhat obvious, they will not have typical sar-cov-2 antibodies. but they may still have protective cross-reactive antibodies against other coronaviruses. covid19 /xit would be fascinating to test for such immunity and antibodies in close contacts of infected individuals who did not become sick. low hanging fruit! covid19 /x science has the capability of presenting an array of targets (proteome) of coronaviruses to test for the presence of these antibodies. covid19 /xit is possible a high viral dose can overcome some level of cross-immunity. that would explain why there are clusters among families or friends. and also some of the cases reported in healthcare workers. covid19 /xglobally we have heard from colleagues in peru, ecuador and greece saying the parking lots were full, we had no more beds. they are gone covid19 /xthe problem is we have no reliable way of knowing who is susceptible, and how is not. i do not recommend anyone reads this as a way to relax our safety measures. but hopefully this give you hope. covid19 /x highly recommends i read the a camus book. highly descriptive of the current situation. covid19 /xin the meantime stay safe, use masks in public, quarantine yourself if ill. and remain hopeful. covid19 /x",26

""to attempt to have intercourse with a hornet's nest is a very bad idea,"" well, i'm glad to have that cleared up. i love that ""psychologist and expert on sexual fantasies"" said ""sex with hornets nest bad idea"" - expert not needed for that! loving that stingy feeling as a swede, i get suspicious where his neighbour is named ""standingboner"".... the neighbors last name sthfrs means a hard on... actually it's not real, gotta understand swedish to get it i love that the conclusion drawn by the sex expert psychologist was having intercourse with a hornet's nest was a bad idea! each to their own i guess but..... unfortunate quote from the neighbour: ""his scrotum was enlarged. right now it feels heavy and unreal."" he was obviously looking for the ultimate buzz! seems delightful..... seems life in sweden is really rough if they are forced to do it! where's the buzz in that??? bet he got a buzz from it! dead body in ystad, stung to death by hornets, surely wallander must investigate this translate the neighbour's name into english you'll get bertil boner, they've just intentionally misspelled ""stfrs"". hmm, and awkward juxtaposition in these sentences: the scrotum was enlarged. right now it feels heavy and unreal. my good gods! this is not only horrible, but kind of stupid to boot. holy cackamoley !! 'twas a hoax m'dear there's one sentence in there that proclaims the whole report to be fabrication. considering his neighbor's last name translates to ""hard-on"", i recommend being sceptical about this one. deadly buzz....! take away the pain, keep the swelling i would guess the hornets were just reacting to being poked. never poke a hornets nest, obviously you might get stung! theres only people youd want with you at worlds end ray mears and stephen hawking but only for wheelchair parts sadly it's not true! happens to the best of us. top five hoax news stories stung trend this taylorswiftformilestoneaward.... spread the word!. true. though i should have realized the hoax when i read the neighbor's name, which means 'boner' in swedish.lmao! funniest hoax ever! rt: this is just about the weirdest fetish i've ever heard of... via ) i think he did it for the buzz. lol an extremely bad idea lol ""shudder"" noac was it sting ? !!!!!!! i nominate that man for a darwin award! agh bit of a sting in the tail! death by a thousand pr*cks perhaps? lx a sting in the tail/tale, perhaps? x at least he got a buzz out of it story was a hoax question is what was he thinking with, is more apt it's a joke, which got lost in translation: just a case of 'never mind the buzz cocks' that's what i call a sting in the tail the human mind that prompts these actions is unbelievable! so bizarre!!! looks like they stuck it back to him, and then some. it's god...thinning the herd. he was trying to immunize his penis against allergies. i adored the documentary on wagner. you looked gorgeous too. how sad and uncomfortable. obvioulsly a very bad case of 'insexst '. he must have got a buzz out of it. it was a hoax, stephen !

0,that's just plain not true. we're not declining as a whole around the country but are holding fairly steady as some states improve but others get worse. and i notice you conveniently ignored all of the data i shared providing context to your first graph. i didnt ignore anything. arguing on social media solves nothing. youll have your opinion no matter what i share. the fact of the matter is the general population of to that is relatively healthy is going to need to be exposed to covid. its called developing heard immunity. hiding in your house from the virus like its a cat burglar does not work. im not saying not to wear your mask. this is false. the vaccine will create immunity as they have for other communicable diseases. there is no need to risk peoples lives until the vaccine because you dont like a mask. what is the goal of a vaccine? you guessed it. herd immunity! not everyone can take a vaccine. people used to have measle and chicken pox parties to get it over with. im not saying covid is the same disease but this idea you have to hide until theres a vaccine is moronic youd rather knowingly let people die to achieve a goal that we will achieve in months without the unnecessary deaths... wait for it... so you dont have to wear a piece of cloth over your mouth sometimes... bless your heart. good bye,0
