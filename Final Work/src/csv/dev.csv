0,"i've read a lot about corona virus lately and i think i should share some highlights of the good read. it's a thread, and in form of q &amp; a.what is a coronavirus? coronavirus is a large family of viruses which may cause illness in animals or humans.in humans, several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging from common cold to mers &amp; sars. the most recently discovered coronavirus is covid-19.how does covid-19 spread? people can catch covid-19 from others who have the virus. the disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with covid-19 coughs or exhales.should i worry about covid-19? although illness due to covid-19 infection is generally mild, especially for children and young adults. it is still quite normal for people to worry about how the covid-19 outbreak will affect them and their loved ones.are antibiotics effective in preventing or treating the covid-19? no. antibiotics do not work against viruses, they only work on bacterial infections. covid-19 is caused by a virus, so antibiotics do not work.is there a vaccine, drug or treatment for covid-19? not yet. to date, there is no vaccine and no specific antiviral medicine to prevent or treat covid-2019. however, those affected should receive care to relieve symptoms. people with serious illness should be hospitalized.is covid-19 the same as sars? no. the virus that causes covid-19 and the one that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars) are related to each other genetically, but they are different. sars is more deadly but much less infectious than covid-19.should i wear a mask to protect myself? only wear a mask if you are ill with covid-19 symptoms (especially coughing) or looking after someone who may have covid-19. the mask can only be used once. if you are not ill/looking after someone who is ill then you are wasting a mask.can i catch covid-19 from my pet? no. there is no evidence that companion animals or pets such as cats and dogs have been infected or could spread the virus that causes covid-19.is there anything i should not do? the following measures are not effective against covid-2019 and can be harmful: . smoking . taking traditional herbal remedies . wearing multiple masks . taking self-medication such as antibiotics.in any case, if you have fever, cough and difficulty breathing seek medical care early to reduce the risk of developing a more severe infection and be sure to share your recent travel history with your health care provider. coronaalert coronavirus coronaoutbreak thread",2

(she's halfway there.) not what she is claiming well, she's a very lucky person to have met him. exactly. she should follow the patriots mantra, ""do your job"". yes just like people do for imagrents. you support or you don't, sorry, too many on the fence, it broke. kimdavis should have kept this meeting private bet that's what pope wanted shes using it to glorify/publicize herself more shameless popeturd is back tracking already... the pc police flexing their muscle again... disgusting; and people still worship this false idol. she got elected in local election when her mom retired from the position. its a small town so go figure kanyeshrug ask potus why does chicago his home town has very strict gun laws &amp; very high gun violence? don't tell me that the vatican us telling a lie the vatican is has given in. smh. kimdavis has more guts and stronger in her faith than the vatican and it pope. too late! what other reason would the pope have for a private meeting (she's not even catholic) he is a holy man giving comfort. most assuredly not! ms. davis has a true commitment to god and his word. the pope has a true commitment to his lavish lifestyle and $$. the things we make news worthy just baffle ones mind, find a solution to oregon like issues then how should we consider it? a show of...??? why are either of these idiots getting any coverage a church desperate to look cool is a sad thing she just needs to go away i'll believe that when popefrancis meets with leaders of the lgbt community the pope sent a clear message by meeting with kimdavis then what should it be considered? unless he performed an exorcism on that witch, it will be considered support. getreal so what is it? with god there is no sitting on the wall too late for this... of course it's a form of support! it just shouldn't have any impact on our political policies. he supported the death row inmate too with that meeting, the pope sadly undid a great deal of what his visit was. then exactly how should the meeting be considered? shouldn't have met with kimdavis to begin with. rewarded bad behavior. pope francis may have spoke against jesus christ but he is not stupid enough to take a stand on nonsense by the kentucky clerk i bet it was more like the pope saying whom is this obnoxious bitch and do i really have to talk to her funny how someone is inevitably going to spin it to be... why the hell not simply stop talking about her of the great things about this pope is he doesn't care about appearances. maybe he was modeling peace &amp; forgiveness but what i heard on news..it seems it was a form of support..it was said that the pope told her she had rights like that which is b.s her supporters had the contacts with papal hierarchy to get this set up - those supporters keeping it in the news what is it then? does catholic church support homosexuality? does it conduct gay marriages? so if all the military and police who protected him on his us visit refused to do their job based on religious beliefs is that ok? then he shouldn't have met with her!! surelookslikeit thank god all of a sudden the memorable visit left a bad taste in my mouth if he doesn't care about appearances, why spin the visit? it was ill conceived and looked terrible for pope. the face of mental illness being made famous. who ya gonna believe - me or the pope? they lyin! gaykentucky refreekimdavis hope he gave her a wtf about being divorced times. . nor forgiveness... why would he meet with her anyway? you lost me, off my list! it is perplexing, read an article yesterday, that said pope was unaware, something to do with vatican politics. that's right people! somebody needs to tell this lady to stop judging! that's a sin! crazylady ~ did he spank her ? well thank god she met the pop though it's sad the vatican knows what the bible says n still don't provide support for kim! sad sad! )kim davies is1 of d most courageous human i know.alone,she stood publically to defend god's guide for mankind's progress&amp;evolution. millions of catholics wait a lifetime to share a moment with a pope.why her?because the pope is a socialist who knows propaganda! popefrancis is a bullshitter maybe not but the pope has a recent history of rejecting an openly gay ambassador from france to the vatican.says much many people ""meet"" with a pope. apparently this was a blessing in dc. he probably never heard of her then wham! he's in a storm. so what was it then? trying to help the sinner stop homophobing? a strategy session? swapping culture war stories? an affair? it's definitely support. but the pope is also someone who has done nothing to stop clergy abuse. so who really cares.with how many of god's gay children did meet? in secret or public? whether supportive or not? so i assume the catholic religion supports same sex marriage? important point is that he met with her and not gay groups. gives quiet support for faithful defending traditional marriage. terrible to follow catholic doctrine by a pope, seriously ? kim davis makes my skin crawl! read the rest of the sentence, not support for all of what she is doing. they qualified it. meaning they support some of it takes a lot of courage to continue being a bigot whilst your country is trying not to be doesn't matter why or what was said. she will put her own spin on it to further her homophobia. just like they do with abortion issue ((saw your status on facebook the other day)) pope met w/her in support of her religious liberty &amp; conscience to put god's law above constitution, which he made clear his position. buy this album if you love the pope he met with a gay couple the day before kim davis he too (pope) will stand before god. but won't be left standing. repent of thy ways &amp; turn to god &amp; his ways. kimdavis -be encouraged that is a lie and the vatican didn't say that. homosexual media lies like homosexuals and lesbians. kimdavis the people standing against gay marriage are the minority. % is not a silent majority. less god, more math. i stand with you kim..god be with you. i dont understand all this nut hugging for the pope anyway. he is a sham and a douche... same as all of them.",297

(block that homie who stay sliding into the dms, issa no for low key low down loving). for sex during covid  : contact is high risk give in-person dates a miss. video dates, sexting &amp; sending nudes or other digital spaces are the way forward. (try throwing in some web based sex toys too). for sex during covid  : kissing can pass covid-19 so avoid kissing those who do not form part of the squad e.g. your close circle. being close makes it easier to track who has got what so thats who you can put (both sets of) lips ontips for sex during covid  : rimming can also spread the virus 'cause the virus has been found to be present in feces, so chill on eating ass for awhile. (you can do it honey). for sex during covid  : now more than ever is the time to keep your sex squeaky clean. wash your hands, cut your nails, scrub your body and keep your sex toys spotless. keep that soap and water close by. for sex during covid  : if your partner(s) seems like they are looking/feeling ill, skip the sex. same thing if you start to feel unwell.tips for sex during covid  : if either you or your partner(s) having condtions that could make covid-19 even more intense (e.g. lung disease, heart disease, diabetes, cancer or a weakened immune system) skip the sex.tips for sex during covid  : keep talking. this time can be tricky, being 'stuck' together can cause some tension. make sure you keep calm and keep chatting about any frustrations. for sex during covid  : check in on people because self isolation can be difficult for some. just 'cause you can't rub up on each other doesn't mean you shouldn't care. love you and want you to come out on the other side of this thing healthy and happy. wash your hands, keep in touch with loved ones and please please, stay home.",0

0,"this would make grocery shopping a pretty serious issue. we've been told that social distancing is what was needed. if these studies are true, then we'd need much more isolation. for what it's worth, i certainly hope that this airborne transmission is disproven. fingers crossed. it would also make the use of masks mandatory for everyone, btw which is something the cdc has been very reluctant to propose. the question i have is why covid-19 is less transmissible than measles if it is actually an airborne transmitted disease? the size of respiratory particles for coronavirus is thought to be larger than for measles, so it was thought to spread less readily. this latest research suggests that these prior assumptions are not correct and that covid19 can spread much more easily than previous guidance. '...the world health organization insists the new coronavirus cannot be transmitted through mosquito bites. to date there has been no information nor evidence to suggest that the new coronavirus could be transmitted by mosquitoes, the who reports.' i thought that article was pretty clear, but here's another one just in case. i'll also clearly say ""there is no evidence that mosquitos can spread the coronavirus"", in the same light that there's no evidence my penis can shoot laser beams.",129

0,"part older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness. people with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical attention. frediboatpart can the virus that causes covid-19 be transmitted through the air? studies to date suggest that the virus that causes covid-19 is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air. see previous answer on how does covid-19 spread?part can covid-19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms? the main way the disease spreads is through respiratory droplets expelled by someone who is coughing. the risk of catching covid-19 from someone with no symptoms at all is very low. however, frediboatpart many people with covid-19 experience only mild symptoms. this is particularly true at the early stages of the disease. it is therefore possible to catch covid-19 from someone who has, for example, just a mild cough and does not feel ill. frediboatpart who is assessing ongoing research on the period of transmission of covid-19 and will continue to share updated findings. frediboatpart can i catch covid-19 from the feces of someone with the disease? the risk of catching covid-19 from the feces of an infected person appears to be low. while initial investigations suggest the virus may be present in feces in some cases, spread through this frediboatpart route is not a main feature of the outbreak. who is assessing ongoing research on the ways covid-19 is spread and will continue to share new findings. frediboatpart because this is a risk, however, it is another reason to clean hands regularly, after using the bathroom and before eating frediboatpart what can i do to protect myself and prevent thespread of disease?

washing your hands with frediboatpart droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus. if you are too close, you can breathe in the droplets, including the covid-19 virus if the person coughing has the disease. avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth. why? hands touch many frediboatpart surfaces and can pick up viruses. once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth. from there, the virus can enter your body and can make you sick. make sure you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene. frediboatpart this means covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. then dispose of the used tissue immediately. why? droplets spread virus. by following good respiratory hygiene you protect the people around you from viruses such aspart cold, flu and covid-19. stay home if you feel unwell. if you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in advance. follow the directions of your local health authority. why? national and local authorities will frediboatpart have the most up to date information on the situation in your area. calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility. this will also protect you and help prevent spread of viruses and other infections. frediboatpart keep up to date on the latest covid-19 hotspots (cities or local areas where covid-19 is spreading widely). if possible, avoid traveling to places especially if you are an older person or have diabetes, heart or lung disease. why?

avoiding contact with others and visits to medical facilities will allow these facilities to operate more effectively and help protect you and others from possible covid-19 frediboatpart why? calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility. this will also help to prevent possible spread of covid-19 and other viruses. frediboatpart how likely am i to catch covid-19? the risk depends on where you are - and more specifically, whether there is a covid-19 outbreak unfolding there. for most people in most locations the risk of catching covid-19 is still low. however, there are now places aroundpart the world (cities or areas) where the disease is spreading. for people living in, or visiting, these areas the risk of catching covid-19 is higher. governments and health authorities are taking vigorous action every time a new case of covid-19 is identified. be sure topart comply with any local restrictions on travel, movement or large gatherings. cooperating with disease control efforts will reduce your risk of catching or spreading covid-19. covid-19 outbreaks can be contained and transmission stopped, as has been shown in frediboatpart china and some other countries. unfortunately, new outbreaks can emerge rapidly. its important to be aware of the situation where you are or intend to go. who publishes daily updates on the covid-19 situation worldwide. you can see these at",46

0,"corona virus. thread.6. so, how does the disease spread? people can catch covid-19 from others who have the virus. the disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with covid-19 coughs or exhales.7. these droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person. other people then catch covid-19 by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth.8. people can also catch covid-19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with covid-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets. this is why it is important to stay more than meter (3 feet) away from a person who is sick.9. can the virus that causes covid-19 be transmitted through the air? studies to date suggest that the virus that causes covid-19 is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air. see previous answer on how does covid-19 spread?10. can covid-19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms? the main way the disease spreads is through respiratory droplets expelled by someone who is coughing. the risk of catching covid-19 from someone with no symptoms at all is very low.11. however, many people with covid-19 experience only mild symptoms. this is particularly true at the early stages of the disease. it is therefore possible to catch covid-19 from someone who has, for example, just a mild cough and does not feel ill.12. what can i do to protect myself and prevent the spread of disease? protection measures for everyone! stay aware of the latest information on the covid-19 outbreak, available on the who website and through your national and local public health authority.13. many countries around the world have seen cases of covid-19 and several have seen outbreaks. authorities in china and some other countries have succeeded in slowing or stopping their outbreaks.13.(a) however, the situation is unpredictable so check regularly for the latest news. you can reduce your chances of being infected or spreading covid-19 by taking some simple precautions:13.(b) regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. why? washing your hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand rub kills viruses that may be on your hands.13. (c) maintain at least metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing. why? when someone coughs or sneezes they spray small liquid droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus.13. (c)... if you are too close, you can breathe in the droplets, including the covid-19 virus if the person coughing has the disease.",1

q: what is your classification system for pandemics if you dont use phase anymore? the only advice for the world is don't trust who. and learn from hkprotesters and taiwan, don't believe any news from ccp,hkg and who. hk have exp from sars, which also infect by china , and ccp lie on the history, and pretend they are savior.don't let them play this trick again. iran needs immediate help and support. healthcare providers are suffering from huge shortage of masks and proper infection prevention materials. a disaster is happening in iran. please start a campaign to help them at least by providing n95 masks. coronavirus irancorona  the image is to small to read! you are killing us. declare the pandemic. who what do you mean by not having a process to declare pandemic? its an essence of your job to inform about diseases, so what the hell... i might be crazy but declaring it a pandemic might help but what do i know its a pandemic. announce it as such for the sake of god! feb.2020 updated forecast of the epidemic of a coronavirus from the city of wuhan (china). if the infection acceleration will persists, then by november , , billion people may become infected, million people can die from the virus. say its a pandemic immediately. people are not getting that it is bad. people need to know and things need to be cancelled. wth are u doing???? please monitor the behavior of the iranian ministry of health in relation to coronavirus; please persuade iran to quarantine qom province please persuade the iranian government to report the actual statistics of coronavirus infections and deaths, not false. from iran declare a pandemic?
