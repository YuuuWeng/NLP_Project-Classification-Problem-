eu displays cowardice when dealing with russia = nazi germany the butler did it.. wasn't that aircraft in a no fly zone? might want to talk with traffic control an find out who would put that plane there is there any doubt that mh was deliberately shot down by russian backed terrorists? putin is supplying military ammo and launchers badly worded headline. what is the difference of ""pushing the button"" and then using the word ""deliberately"".... the button was pushed is this not baseless accusation and bizzare cnn should change its name to pnn propaganda news network shameful reporting its not a child's toy to fire such missile with just single push of button. grow up!! ?? the answer please! the ukrainian regime is shelling civilian areas in contested areas of their own country. shelling civilians is a warcrime. seal team ought to bring the guy in that did the kill order and the commander that gave the order.this is a despicable act!!!! they're all liers. everyone tries to cover there's or someone else's ass. horrible situation if true. israeli scholar mordechai came from kedara: ""please rape palestinian women"" this is all story set up by ukraine to start wwiii this is what i've been saying all along. this is insane.. of course cnn is spreading ukr lies but don't want publish these questions to ukr &amp; usa ukraine talks as if they were present beside the russian officer when he pushed the button and why! for what! is this our civilization ... without rudders!!!! pathetic. not help at all. in yesterdays un hearing ukraine didn't look trusty. too much ""evidence"" proven faked - buk i still believe deep down that the mh17 downing was on purpose at the time not knowing it was passenger plane but accidental after???? the russians are chess masters, they are not stupid enough to push the button themselves. that's an amazing deliberate nonsense ! can we do the same deliberately to him and his family ? huh! shameonrussia: russian officer ""pushed the button"" &amp; shot down mh17, ukrainian gov. says: i don't believe it this is just western propaganda against russia, first voice ur concern about gaza then we will see missile path could be from opposite direction, could be a similar us missile triggered by cia or ukraine ! since it is done by russian, the yechury leftists do not want any rs debate how can he now it was russian officer? can't help but wonder if this is mere propaganda coming from ukraine or if it is, in fact, fact. breaking satellite images of ukraine buk deployed km from mh17 crash site why is the western media taking sbu (ex kgb) misinformation so seriously? if this is true intention equals terrorism. no reason to target civilians. some how seal will not be triumphant against the russian special forces! cnn reported this bullshit but not the ukrainian parliament fighting? ukrainian gov.still dreaming r woke up already?if this happens in syria than assad was responsible in ukr,then putin have to blame ??? then he should be shot !!!!!!!!!!!!! and just how do they know that? unless this can be proven why report it. it is nothing but speculation o please stop the b***shit how could an aircraft flying at that altitude toward russia be mistaken for ukrainian military? there should be someone, or perhaps a country responsible for this heinous act..they must pay! that officer and whoever participated should brought to the international justice system. at it's finest. no real facts but still getting people to think what they want them too. : a russian officer ""pushed button deliberately"" nothing happens in russian controlled terrotry without putins control askcnntonight nice joke how dangerous is putin ? given the historical evidence concerning some western leaders putim seem like a pussy catthere is no evidence presented of their sayings. are we supposed to believe the ""ukraine intelligence"" word for it? or cnn word for it? get well soon cnn western media doing its true job-- nato propaganda says friends of alexander borodai read more wow! drawn with crayons? you forgot to add the little man with a rocket ....this fooling nobody to look at . t yes he did, but he also didn't know it was a passenger plane. obviously thought it was a military plane! the truth is ""not helpful."" it doesn't matter to know who pressed the button.the fact is that the human life seems that lost the value!! point marked as a place missile launch is on the territory controlled by ukrainian troops, as before, and now it is clear that the usa and ukraine terrorists. axis of evil. got a name? everything is possible. pl do not spread baseless rumours until the truth is established otherwise you will lose your credibility word. times infinity.your ""evidence"" is pathetic. just like it was for syria in august . give it up. no one believes you anymore colinclownpowell you are absolutely off your rockers! you are making a complete arse of yourselves! fox &amp; you are neck &amp; neck for idiot of the year! date in bottom left is . oops :he should rot in hell! another reason why i hate politics, killing lives without mercy. no story in there - some uke guy says we have a tape but there's no evidence of a tape - total bs story a yr old could do",726

i expect there are even more stay at home mothers these days, even if they prefer to work outside the home. this goes along with their ""children are raised by the community"" stick - kids need moms &amp; dads - not day care helpers! stay-at-home moms are the most important people in the development of our future leaders! sarah! i love your american face! weary of a muslim face! obama thinks it's better for someone other than a mom to raise and influence their children. maybe because his mom failed. if my blood boiled any harder i would simply combust. this is the most asinine thing i have ever heard. great roar smh. you are the anti-feminist. gave $100k to a ak hospital w no publicity?
